# Slip box by Niklas Luhmann

**Slip box**

"The techincal equipment of the slip box includes wooden boxes with compartments that can be pulled out to the front and slips of paper in octavo format. These slips of paper should be written on one side only, so that one can read from the front when searching" (Niklas Luhmann) in: http://infosoc.uni-koeln.de/synapsen/MnemoNet/MnemoNet.html

"Each note is only one element, which gets its quality only from the network of references and back-references in the system." ([28], page 58) At the end of each entry are keywords that act as hyperlinks to related entries. The program "Synapsen" generates this list automatically by comparing newly created keywords with all exsiting ones. Two entries that appear under the same keyworde are linked by "Synapsen" on both sides with hyperlinks. This gives rise to a line of thought which can be picked up during a later reading session.

If the keyword is unknown, it is saved in memory and the keyword directory together with a reference to the current entry. Each subsequent entry with the same keyword refers back to the refeence entry by two-way linking. "As a result of prolonged work with this technique, a kind of second memory is created, an alter ego with which one can communicate continuously." ([28], page 57)

The reference list of each entry serves as a strating point for an encyclopedic reading journey through your own text memory, which thus sets off connectable thoughts in related texts. Thematically bundled, the list provides an associative index that constructs lines of reasoning by reminding readers forgotten texts by hyperlinks.
