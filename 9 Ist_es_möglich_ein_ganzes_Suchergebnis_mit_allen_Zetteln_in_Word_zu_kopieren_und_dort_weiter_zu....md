# Is it possible to copy a whole search result with all notes into Microsoft Word and to continue...

Yes. This can be done with the export function in the File menu of the search result window. The search results can then be exported as text file. It is recomended to enable "Save continously in a file" and "Save in RichTextFormat". The exported RTF file can be edited with Microsoft Word afterwards.
