**What is the benefit of a slip box?** 

It is by no means a simple memory aid, which allows to read and remember what has been written down at a given time. A slip box is also a sorting aid due to the possibility to rearange its movable units in a well-defined, i.e. standardized, uniform format. The decisive factor is not the individual entry, bit the arrangement of a multitude of slips of paper accordung to a sophisticated set of rules that combines and interconnects the modular text pieces according to a dofferentiated system. In addition, a card index in turn serves as a search engine with the help of the finely structured systematic or alphabetical order schemes and registers. Finally, you can use it as a calculating machine in the strict sense of the etymology of calculating as "arranging", "directing", and "preparing" of possible augmentations for its user by linkages and cross references.
