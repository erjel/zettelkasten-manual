**note relationship**

The key factor during the registration of published texts in a slip box or catalog remains the mapping relation between slip and book. In contrast to the firmly fixed entries of a continued list on strict successive book pages (i.e. excerpt notebooks), slips of paper can be formed as freely movable units in ever new arrangements. A slip of paper initally serves as a single pointer that points to an address, the location of the writing on the shelf, just like a signature. Yet it does not only points to the location where the text can be found, but also contains a highly compressed sample of data which characterizes the book. In the optimal case, the note - additionally to the bibliographic data (with detailed title, subtitle, involved authors, etc.) - a brief indexing of the content. It thus provides a derivative of the text it represents. The "title copy" becomes not only an administrator of access, but also a representative of the writing, which thus sometimes does not even be read itself. The representative dunction distracts from what it references. Reading the table of contents or just only the title prevents further reading. Thus it is hardly surprising that around 1800 - in times of a flood of books in newly created libraries -the representation on small, movable cards experienced a first boom. This is also the case with another reduction to (noble) titles, in which signifiers henceforth henceforht became superfluous: "One comes to one of our famous spas, a couple of hours after arrival sends around a couple of hundred visit cards, and the same day one is introduced to the whole society of spa guests, and is as familiar with two to three hundred people as if one had already lived with them for many years".
(Anonym, "Neueste Moden in Visiten-Karten". In: Journal des Luxus und der Moden, Vol. 10, 1795, pp. 147-150, p. 148. Meanwhile, reading doctoral and noble titles on small cards is akin to accessing books that one does not read, but nevertheless knows - at least ther titles and names.)
