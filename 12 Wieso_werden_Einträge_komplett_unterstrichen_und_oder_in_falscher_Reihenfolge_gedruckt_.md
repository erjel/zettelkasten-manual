# Why are entries underlined completely and/ or in the wrong order during printing?

*Zettelkasten* uses for the visualization of text and during the printing of entries a certain Windows component. This component varies depending on the Windows and Office version. Probably the error emerges due to an older version of this specific component which leads to fraudulent print outs. Currently no fix is available.
