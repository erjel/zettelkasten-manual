# Zettelkasten - General

With *Zettelkasten* you can collect, archive, and organize literature comments, text snippets, and citations. The principle is based on the (physical) slip-box used by Niklas Luhmann. Each item contains a source reference and keywords. This simplifies the linking of related topics and allows the user to lookup and search for existing notes.

# Search
You can execute multiple search queries in parallel without losing old queries. The search results can be saved and remain accessible in future sessions. The search results can be further refined with the different filter options such that even larger note collections can be managed easily.

The program contains several search options such as keyword-based, text-based, and author-based search. Interesting entries can be marked with bookmarks.

# Import and Export
All entries, search resutls, or bookmarked notes can easily be printed, exported, or imported. This works for single notes, a user-defined selection, or the complete collection. 


# Data entry
The numerous input aids not only save tedious typing work, but also provide support for the thematic assignment of keywords to the entries. Links to websites, office, or graphic files etc. can be added to the entries.

# Glossary

Additionally, a glossary for field-specific words can be created. A manually editable autocorrect function is also available, so that frequent corrections of spelling mistakes are avoided. All functions can be conveniently executed via shortcuts.
