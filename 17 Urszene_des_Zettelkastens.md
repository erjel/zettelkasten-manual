# The history of slip boxes 

**The history of slip boxes**

Perhaps the earliest explicit description of the use of notes to capture a large amount of knowledge was used by Konrad Gessner (1516--1565), polyhistor and father of modern bibliography. He maintained his alphabetical and systematic lists of books -- single-handedly, of course, and in years of slitary and laborious work. The basis of his activity was a careful and all-encompassing collection of literature, whereby GEssner did not shy away from including even remote and off-the-beaten-path information.

"I have gathered the material from everywhere: from catalogs of printes, of which I have gathered quite a few from different regions; from catalogs of libraries, also from libraries themselves, public as well as private, which I have carefully consulted throughout Germany and Italy, from letters of friend, from reports of scholars, and finally from catalogs of writers."
(Gessner, Konrad, 1545, Bibliotheca Universalis, sive Catalogus omnium scriptorum locupletissimus, in tribus linguis, Latina, Graeca, & Hebraica, Christoph Froschauer, Zürich, Vol. 3r, translated by Zedelmaier, Helmut, 1992, Bibliotheca universalis und Bibiliotheca selecta. Das Problem der gelehrten Ordnung in der frühen Neuzeit, Bd. 33 von Beihefte zum Archiv für Kulturgeschichte, Böhlau, Köln, Weimar, Wien, S. 22f.)

How to proceed with the accumulated material, Gessner willingly provides information under the corresponding system passage of his Pandectae, the second volume of the Bibliotheca Universalis, called "De indicibus librorum". First of all, it is necessary to read, and in particular those books that have an index, in order to use the listed items for personal indices. For this purpose, the chapter headings are recorded and used as locos communes. This procedure suggests, not without readon, that the Bibliotheca Universalis itself can be viewed as an index of indexes, or a meta index of second order.
The processing of the excerpts, the -- and this term is to be taken literally -- note taking, follows the simplest of all suitable algorithms:

1. During reading, everything of importance and what promises later usefulness has to be written on  to a sheet of good quality, one-sided paper. 
2. Every new thought is captured in a new line. 
3. "Finally you should cut up everything you noted down with scissors; but the parts you should arrange as you please, first into larger divisions, which you then subdivide again once or twice, as as often as it will be necessary."
(Gessner, Konrad, 1548, Pandectarum sive Partitionum universalium, Christoph Froschauer, Zürich, Vol. 20r, translated by Zedelmaier, Helmut, 1992, Bibliotheca universalis und Bibiliotheca selecta. Das Problem der gelehrten Ordnung in der frühen Neuzeit, Bd. 33 von Beihefte zum Archiv für Kulturgeschichte, Böhlau, Köln, Weimar, Wien, S. 104.)
4. Once the desired order is established, arranged, and sorted on tables or in small boxes, it must be fixed, unless it is copied directly. 

Fixing means to capture the movable slips of paper / paper scraps on a sheet, to fix them with glue.  Yet, the fixation should always provide an option for displacement, so that either a water-soluble glue must be used, or a system that allows insertions, rearrangements, in short movability even afterwards without mush effort.
