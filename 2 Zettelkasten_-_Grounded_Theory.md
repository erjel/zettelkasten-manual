# Zettelkasten - Grounded Theory

With *Zettelkasten* it is possible to analyze empirical data from the field of qualitative social research. If you, for example, work according the Grounded Theory according to Glaser and Strauss, you can use the program to easily incorporate paragraphs from interview transcripts. In this case, the keyword assignment becomes the equivalent of the coding of text passages.

With the help of the various search and keyword functions, a synoptic analysis (i.e. case-comparatove or thematically and cross-case) of the data material becomes trivial.

Contradictions in the data which are indicated by the different codes, are tracable with the keyword relation function. This underscores the added value not only in the data organization but also for the data analysis.
