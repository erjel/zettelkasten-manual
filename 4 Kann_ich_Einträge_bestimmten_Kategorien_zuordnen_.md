# Can I add entries to categories?

No, you cannot. While many programs for managing notes allow the user to structre the entries in hierarchical categories, *Zettelkasten* deliberately does not follow this principle. By preventing the user from categorization, the note order decouples from the note content. In combination with the tagging of notes, an interconnected system of entries is created which facilitates creative randomness (see also the (German) comment on Luhmann's slip box http://www.sciencegarden.de/meinung/200107/lxuhmann/luhmann.php on Sciencegarden.de).
