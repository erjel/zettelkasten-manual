*Zettelkasten* does not preserve formating from other programs but removes it once the input of an entry is finished. User-defined formatting during the text entry is supported. A standard approach would be to activate the option "Keep original formatting when inserting" in the basic settings. This preserves the text formatting of the copied text. Now it depends to the user to apply the *Zettelkasten* formatting commands manually to preserve the original formatting of the words/phrases. Otherwise the formatting will be removed upon saving.
