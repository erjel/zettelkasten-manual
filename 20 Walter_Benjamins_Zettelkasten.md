# Walter Benjamin's slip box

**Walter Benjamin's slip box**

"The script, which had found an asylum in the printed book, where it led its autonomous existence, is inexorably dragged out into the street by advertisements [...]. If centuries ago it gradually began to settle down, from the upright inscription to the handwriting resting diagonally on the desks, in order to finally bed down in the printed book, it now begins just as slowly to lift itself off the ground again. Already the newspaper is read more in the vertical than in the horizontal [...] And before the contemporary gets to open a book, such a dense flurry of changeable, colorful, quarreling letters has descended upon his eyes that the chances of his penetrating the archaic silence of the book have become slim. Locust swarms of writing [...] Other requirements of business life lead on. The cartotheque brings the conquest of three-dimensional writing, that is, a surprising counterpoint to the three-dimensionality of writing in its origin as rune or knot writing. (And today, as the current scientific mode of production teaches, the book is already an obsolete mediation between two different cartothecary systems. For everything essential is found in the notebook of the researcher who wrote it, and the scholar who studies in it assimilates it to a cartotheque of his own."
(Walter Benjamin (1972): Einbahnstra√üe. In: Gesammelte Schriften  IV-1. Frankfurt am Main. Pp. 84-148, here: 103)
