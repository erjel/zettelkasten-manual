# Wooden artificial intelligence

**Wooden artificial intelligence**

Around the world, resarchers try to model artificial intelligence. The sociologist Niklas Luhmann only needed wood and paper for this. His legendary slip box knew more than he himself ...

Within the first pages of Luhmanns literature the question of his knowledge management system arises. The plentora of information within the footnotes and comments does not fit in any head. Whoever tries to collect full text of the cited references - of even a single essay - soon reaches the boundary of his/ her bibliographic skillset. Everything, starting from Spanish auristocrat manifesto from the middle ages to peer review article from any thinkable discipline from the last 200 years, is used. Undergrad student will struggle with the rich reference and source information of scientific literature: How can a single person find, read, analyze, and remember that many books and articles? Additional to exercise and increasing literature experience a simple method is needed: slip boxes. Hence it is less important what a scientist can remember but rather whether he/ she well organizes the sorting, finding, and searching.

Next to the normal research slip boxes are created, in which cards note information which is cited often. Students first start with this method during their theses. Notes are sorted alphabetically according to keywords and authors. Everything which was sorted into the slip boxes can be extracted with ease. The slip box tend to know less than the person itself, but always as much as is noted on the cards.

If you enter Luhmann's world of systems theory, you quickly realize that nothing is as you thought. His card box - which was broight to a Bielefeld archive for examination by a moving company after his death - does not follow the usual alphabet. In his essay "Communication with Slip Boxes," the sociologist shared what happens when we let systems theory becomes handy.
In his report, Luhmann treats his slip box like an independent communication parner that he has raised, which grows, and eventually produces ideas on its own. A prerequisite for this magic - his box not only knows what he has sorted in, but more and more - is a certain period of growth. Only after a few years does its own complexity unfold, which unfortunaely can hardly achieved for the time scale of a single thesis.

For the trained administrative lawyer, systematic work was compulsively close at hand, so he early considered a system for organizing his notes. He decided, however, not for an alphabetrical, but for a numerical and therefore an from the content abstracted order. Over the years, he continously turned his reading into notes. Since index cards soon became too thick for him, he used normal paper in octavo format. At thetop left, the cards are numbered, on the remaining area notes on various topics can be found. The notes follow the reading or the movements of the thoughts. With the number, the location of the card in the box remains fixed.

The advantage of this order is the brnaching ability and the ability of the slip box to grow inward endlessly. The individual numbers can be extended and continued at will. "A slip of paper with the number 57/12 can then be continued in the running text via 57/13 etc., but can at the same time be supplemented from a certain word or thoguth with 57/12a, continously via 57/12b etc.; whereby internally then 57/12a1 etc. can be connected again." On the slip of paper, the connection points and references can be marked in color. Clusters thus slowly formaround certainconcepts as we branch out and continue in many directions; other notes turn out to be isolated and are forgotten over time (by the slip box).

Detaching content from each other also allows for one box that contains the notes on all topics and areas of work, and that it has creative randomness already build in through references. The notes are clearly disordered, but in a "disorder with non-arbitrary internal structure." Since we have troubel remembering numbers, a register of alphabetical keywords serves to help us to find notes again.

If we search for something under a keyword in the register, numbers are found. We then start our query by drawing the vard with one of these numbers and follow the branches: So for example from 57/12 to 57/13a and so on. Thus, if we ask the box for "morality", we can come to the memories of "Marlene Dietrich", who described her mother as being influenced by "Immanuel Kant"and his "concept of duty", or finally to Kant's famous "Categorical Imperative".

In another direction, however, we come from "morality" via "Marlene Dietrich" to "Goethe", because Dietrich'S memoirs are called "So nehmt nur mein Leben ..." and this is a line from a Goethe poem. However, we can now follow the trce that lead from "Goethe" as well as the on starting from "Mother" on to "Mother's Day" and "Holidays in National Socialism" or "Horror Film". These chains, which emerge ccording to inquiry and networking, are more than we wrote on individual cards and more than a mere alphabetical order can provide. The numerical card box can therefore constantly irritate us with its own complexity. In an alphabetical system, the connection between Marlene Dietrich and Immanuel Kant clound not have arisen, unless it had occured to the user by chance. Luhmann's order, however, not only archived the connections that have occured to us at some point, but also constantly generates new ones.

A footnote in Luhmann's essay reveals to what depth of branching this second memory, with which you can communicate, leads over the decades: "My card index gives the references to this under the number 21/3d26f104,1 ...". So whoever raises such a wooden life partner will get more and more interesting answers to his questions after a few years ...
